### Asset files

The directory `assets` contains asset files (css, js, pngs, etc.) specfic
for this release. They will be deployed to a release-specific directory
so as not to conflict with prior releases.

To add an asset file:

1. Copy the file to the `assets` directory
2. Add the file name to the `data-files:` section of the .cabal file.
3. In `buildAllPages`, add a call to `copyDataFile` to copy the asset file
to the build directory.

To reference an asset file in a page, use the `asset` function defined in
`Render.Base` to create a relative url:

    asset :: String -> AttributeValue

When creating a new release, simply change the value of `asset_dir`
to ensure that assets for the new release don't conflict with
assets for previous releases.
